A Java Swing GUI version of a Sudoku game implementation, in which it performs depth-first search with backtracking technique to search for all possible solution(s).   

The analysis of the time complexity of searching the solution:  Overall, it runs O(n^2 * m!), where n is the number of the outer and number of the inner buckets of the Sudoku game (i.e. in total there are 9 x 9 = 81 buckets) and m is the average total number of the possible values of each bucket.   Notice that m = n in the worst case senario.
