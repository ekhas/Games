All board and chess games: 

1) Chinese Chess Pro - A Chinese chess program written by me a year ago to stimulate a 'smart' computer robot to play the Chinese chess game with human (i.e. us).

2) Sudoku Solver - A Java Swing GUI version of a Sudoku game implementation, in which it performs depth-first search with backtracking technique to search for all possible solution(s).

3) Texas Holdem Pro - A Texas Holdem casino game that I wrote a year ago for fun. The user can play against the number computer players (3 to 7) simultaneously. The computer players are programmed with its simple artificial intelligence (i.e. A.I.) system to make a move against us.
